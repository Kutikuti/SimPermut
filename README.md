# SimPermut

## Overview

This repository is for the addon SimPermut which make a string usable by SimulationCraft with all the different permutations for the items you have in your inventory. This makes easy comparing stuff.


## How Can I Use It?

/SimPermut


## Known issues and developement plan

-keep selected/unselected items when adding/removing slots to permut

-Clean copies (remove copy with same items as base, remove duplicated copies due to finger/trinket permutations)

-Add a warning if numerous items are selected (30+) that the string generation can be long and freeze the game

-Code cleanup
