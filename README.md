## How Can I Use It?

/SimPermut


Select the slots to permut from the dropdown on the top left.

Select which items you want to sim.

Add enchants and gems on items that don't have any (you can force replace enchant and gem by selecting the force checkbox).

Click Generate.

Copy the text and paste in simc.


## Known issues and developement plan

-Keep selected/unselected items when adding/removing slots to permut

-Clean copies (remove duplicated copies due to finger/trinket inversion)

-Clip the text frame on the right of the frame

-Add gems and enchant to the item list to select for each item

-Rename copy to add stat rating for a better overlook in simc

-More accurate socket detection with getiteminfo (can't add gems on legendaries and crafted items atm)
